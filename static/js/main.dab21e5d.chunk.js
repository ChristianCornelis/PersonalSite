My first goal was to gain more knowledge and understanding of the causes and effects of nutrient loss from agricultural lands, and the ways it can occur. I felt that by focusing on this goal,     it would help me with my day-to-day tasks at AAFC by giving me a strong background to assist with the data analysis and modification that I was doing. By the end of my first work term, I feel that I have gained a strong background of what causes nutrient loss from agricultural lands: poor fertilizer application timing, over-application of fertilizers, and poor manure application timing were a few of the causes that I learned about.","     My second goal was to work on my public speaking skills and become more comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas. I chose to develop this area of my communication skillset because I felt that I had not really had a chance to develop it during my previous academic semesters since most of my work was independently-done.  I worked to contribute my thoughts in staff meetings and other group settings and contribute to work-based     discussions more often. By the end of my first work term, I felt that I was much more confident sharing my ideas in group settings and speaking my mind.","     My third goal was to work on gaining some experience collaborating on programming projects with others and ensuring that my programs were properly-documented to be understandable to people with little-to-no programming experience. I formed this goal due to how some of my co-workers had to go through my code and document how the IROWC-P algorithm was being implemented. I worked to ensure that my programs had acceptable readability     and clarity through use of Pythonic principles and proper commenting practices. My first work term gave me the opportunity to work on the IROWC-P algorithm alongside another computing co-op student, which gave me a lot of experience with programming collaboration for the first time. By the end of my first work term with AAFC, I felt that my programs worked will with those of my computing co-worker, and that my programs were very readable and well-documented for use by my non-computing co-workers.","     In my second term, I decided to focus more on my programming skills, specifically on sharpening my skills working in the Python programming language and adhering to the paradigms and principles that it encapsulates. My first goal was to hone my knowledge and skills of programming in Python by continuing to learn the proper techniques and methodologies of this language. I felt that by doing this, the quality of my code would be vastly    improved, and it would aid in furthering my comfortability using Python. By the end of the second term, I found that I was more skilled and knowledgeable in programming in Python and felt substantially more comfortable using the language.","     My second goal for my second work term was to work to become more effective and creative at solving complex problems that occurred when developing the IROWC-P program. I felt that this goal was necessary because brainstorming creative solutions to implementing complex algorithms in Python became a large part of my daily routine in the second work term, as I no longer had another programmer working alongside me. I felt that by completing     this goal, it would speed up debugging sessions and further my productivity while programming. I was successful in completing this goal by the end of the semester as I was much more efficient at implementing algorithms that were incorporated into the IROWC-P algorithm and debugging at the end of the semester then I was at the beginning of my work term. Solving complex problems that occurred when developing the IROWC-P program became less problematic due to my efficiency in their implementation.","     My final goal for my second work term was to continue to sharpen my skills and efficiency when debugging. Over the course of my first work term, I felt that my debugging skills could use improvement when working on an algorithm to allocate fertilizer sales data for use by the IROWC-P program. This algorithm proved to be a particularly challenging aspect of my co-op position, as it required extensive critical thinking and planning to implement,     as constant manipulation of data to and from multiple geographic scales was vital to the algorithm. In the end, I felt that I was successful in completing this goal, as I could debug this algorithm extensively and more efficiently. I continued to methodically debug by stepping through the program bits at a time and focus on where bugs originated from, rather than trying to look at the entire program at once and solve the issue."],f=["This work term, I focused on developing my technical skills, as I felt that my previous two work terms developed my soft skills quite well. My first goal was to improve my debugging     skills in order to be more efficient when dealing with bugs in demo builds. I felt that by improving my debugging skills I could be more efficient when creating demo environments for     the sales team. By the end of the term, I felt that I was successful in completing this goal. I utilized PHPStorm\u2019s Debugger service to diagnose and fix bugs that I experienced throughout     my work, and became much more efficient and finding and fixing bugs once I was familiar with Tulip\u2019s stack.","My second goal was to work to become more experienced modifying and creating PHP scripts. I felt that by focusing on becoming a more experienced PHP developer it would lead to me creating     more intricate web applications and assist me in creating interesting side projects. At the end of the term, I felt that I was very successful in achieving this goal. I was able to write     multiple web app back-ends in PHP, as well as modify other developer\u2019s scripts to be more efficient. I am now much more proficient at writing and modifying PHP scripts, and am quite familiar     with the language\u2019s built-in functions and tools. I hope to continue to work with PHP as my work with it this work term has made me very fond of it.","The third goal that I set for this work term was to gain more experience working on complex iOS apps in Swift. After completing CIS 4500, which focused on iOS application development using Swift,     I felt that this completing this goal would be quite rewarding, as it was an excellent opportunity to expand on what I learned in my academics; however, I was not able to complete it due to my team\u2019s     priorities changing.  I will point out that I was given the opportunity to do some light iOS work by modifying some apps to adhere to the needs of the sales team, which was very challenging and informative.     Instead of working on an iOS app integration, as was planned, I was able to work on a Google Pub Sub library in PHP, which was extremely interesting.","The fourth goal I set for myself was to improve my documenting skills in order to convey my work and bug fixes more effectively to my team members. Upon completing my onboarding at Tulip, I found that I was     very prepared to fulfill most of the duties expected of me as part of my job, but felt that there was a lack of documentation to complete smaller, more intricate tasks that were required to upkeep demos for the     sales team. By completing this goal, I was creating useful documentation for future co-op students as well, which I thought would be very beneficial. I feel that I was very successful in completing this goal as my     documenting skills have sharpened immensely through my own hard work and very helpful feedback on my documentation from co-workers.","The fifth, and final, goal that I set for this work term was to become more experienced in developing web applications. Although this is quite a broadly-defined goal, I felt that it was very beneficial for me to     focus on, as the only web development experience I had previous to this work term was from assignments completed in CIS 2750. After this work term, I feel that I was very successful in completing this goal, as I     gained a vast amount of experience in developing web applications. I was able to work with another co-op student to create a web application (as well as other web apps) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend,     and PHP for the backend, which was very informative, challenging, and fun. Through working towards this goal, I have discovered that I really enjoy building and developing web applications, and am eager to learn more!"],w=["During my first semester, I chose to set more technical goals for myself, as I was working with a tech stack that I was completely unfamiliar with. My first goal was to gain experience developing and enhancing web applications using React and Redux. To achieve this goal, I worked to pick up front-end tickets that I felt were within my abilities to complete, and asked for assistance when necessary if a ticket was challenging. By the end of my first semester at Magnet, I felt that I had achieved this goal. I adhered to plans on how to achieve this goal, and became very comfortable working with React and Redux by completing tickets of varying difficulty and asking my mentor for assistance and advice whenever necessary. The vast majority of the tickets I completed on STS, approximately seventy-eight percent, involved working with React and Redux, which I feel shows how much I was able to worth with these frameworks.","My second goal while on STS was to improve my written communication skills by providing my team members with useful feedback when performing code reviews and documenting my own work. To complete this goal, I planned to review my team members\u2019 code that I felt I could understand in a short period of time, and could provide meaningful comments and insight into. I felt that this goal was successfully completed by the end of my first semester, to an extent. I feel that by providing useful comments for all code that I wrote that I was able to expedite my coworkers' review process on my own code, as it enabled them to quickly understand the intention of methods and classes that may not have been apparent at first glance. I reviewed fellow team members' code whenever I had the chance, which provided great experience in familiarizing myself with others' code bases quickly and efficiently to review their updates; however,\tI didn\u2019t feel that I had logged as many hours reviewing code as I had intended to by the end of the semester. Because of this, I chose to continue working towards this goal during my time on Review.","My third goal was to gain experience creating unit tests for all code that I wrote. At previous co-op placements, testing was not a focus of the teams that I worked on, and so I was never able to gain experience writing tests with a high percentage of code-coverage, or tests that would be included in automated build processes. To achieve this goal, I planned to test all functions, components, and logic that I introduced while on the Software Tools and Systems team. By the end of the semester, I felt that I had successfully achieved this goal.  Seeing as I had no experience writing unit tests prior to this co-op term, I feel I'm very capable of doing so now, and feel that working towards this goal has made me think of how I implement solutions to complex problems in order to ensure testability. I was able to gain experience working with testing frameworks in C#, React, and Python, and achieved over eighty percent code \tcoverage in my tests once I started using our code-coverage tool to measure how my tests performed, which I am very proud of.","My fourth, and final goal during my time on STS was to become more experienced tracking unwanted behavior in Jenkins builds and jobs to improve their performance and efficiency wherever possible. To achieve this goal, I planned to work through tickets pertaining to Jenkins jobs and gain an understanding of how the build system worked to be able to track unwanted behavior efficiently. I feel that I was able to achieve this goal to some degree, but that there was room for improvement yet. There were some issues I was not able to diagnose causes for, due to their complexity, but I was capable of diagnosing and fixing less-complex issues that occurred throughout the semester. I feel that four months time may not have been sufficient to achieve this goal fully.","During my second semester at Magnet, I chose to focus on both technical and communication goals. In order to aid in measuring the following goals, I sent out a survey to my fellow team  members to gain their perspectives on how they felt I contributed to the team in the areas that my goals focused on.","As I wasn\u2019t able to fully-complete my code review goal to the extent that I had hoped last semester, I chose to continue honing my skills in that area. To achieve this goal, I worked to become a more proficient code reviewer and work to be able to have meaningful and helpful suggestions when reviewing others' work. To achieve this I planned to perform code reviews whenever possible and make a considerable effort to make suggestions to improve efficiency and readability whenever possible. I also planned to ask why certain patterns were chosen in place of others to gain a deeper understanding of decision-making to improve upon my own work. At the end of my time on Review, the survey that I sent to my fellow team members indicated that I was successful in achieving this goal, which echoes how I feel. I gained valuable insight into decisions that were made when implementing new features or refactoring old code, and was\table to spark helpful discussions with my reviews over the course of the semester.","My second goal during my time on Review was to collaborate with others to help the team deliver on features and fixes more quickly, while gaining experience coding with another team member. To achieve this goal, I communicated that I was available to help drive work that was in-progress to completion through pairing on tickets. By the end of the semester, I felt that I achieved this goal to its full potential - I was able to pair with fellow team members on multiple occasions to complete large tickets, and gained valuable experience splitting work into manageable slices. The survey that I sent to my co-workers indicated that I was very successful in this area. Suggestions that I received pertaining to this goal were to stop apologizing for my lack of experience when working on unfamiliar tasks, and to continue with my collaboration efforts, which I plan to do when I enter the workforce post-graduation.","My third goal was to become experienced in testing other people's code by the end of the semester. There was a lot of opportunity to work towards this goal, as build verification testing was completed as a team prior to each release, and testing was completed on each ticket prior to being landed to the product\u2019s master branch. To achieve this goal, I contributed to build verification testing, and quality assurance as a whole, whenever possible. I asked for assistance from both developers and testers on the team whenever necessary to ensure my testing efforts were covering sufficient test cases. I felt that I gained an extensive amount of experience in testing during my time on Review, which allowed me to complete this goal with ease. My survey indicated that I was successful in completing this goal as well, and some suggestions that were brought forth included continuing making an effort to test others\u2019 code, as it\tcontributes to growth as a developer, and continuing to keep thorough notes and test plans when working in this area. I value that this goal made me realize that development will continue to be my path in the computing industry, but I now value testing experience to a higher degree, as it attributes to a higher understanding of the product that I am working on.","My fourth and final goal during my time on Review was to be more vocal of my opinions and ideas in a team setting. This goal was added later into my time on Review as a result of a performance evaluation that was completed in the middle of my term, as my mentor and supervisor indicated that I should voice my opinion on discussions during team planning, standup, and retrospective meetings. In order to achieve this goal, I strived to speak my mind at least once per meeting, under the condition that my input was valuable, and not just input contributed for the sake of doing so. In working towards this goal, I made an effort to ponder on suggestions that were brought forth in meetings and ask valuable questions to broaden my understanding of concepts that I was unfamiliar with, as well as provide my feedback on ideas whenever appropriate. I feel I was successful in speaking up more in meetings by the end of the term,\tspecifically due to being able to work for an extended duration on a large performance evaluation task. The survey I sent to my coworkers indicated that I was successful in improving upon this over the course of the semester as I had hoped to. Working towards this goal was very valuable in that it provided me with more confidence as a developer on the team by having my voice heard, and questions answered. Overall, this goal made me more comfortable working with my team as a whole."],y=function(e){function t(){var e,a;Object(d.a)(this,t);for(var o=arguments.length,n=new Array(o),i=0;i<o;i++)n[i]=arguments[i];return(a=Object(h.a)(this,(e=Object(m.a)(t)).call.apply(e,[this].concat(n)))).state={},a}return Object(g.a)(t,e),Object(c.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e={};switch(this.props.location.pathname){case"/aafc":e={introduction:"My name is Christian Cornelis and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph.

My time at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has made me extremely comfortable working with large datasets, as I worked with datasets of Crop Yields, Geographic break-downs, and Census data as part of my day-to-day programming. I worked hard to create scripts to ingest large datasets efficiently and effectively to maintain fast processing time and ease the process of running these scripts.     My second work term at AAFC helped me to become a much more independent worker. During my first work term, I had the pleasure of programming alongside another computing co-op student, but during my second term, I programmed completely on my own. This change in my work habits helped me to focus a lot on sharpening my abilities to learn and solve problems independently, and I feel that this experience of independence was just as important as working alongside another programmer.",goals:p,conclusion:"     In conclusion, my work terms at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada have been remarkable and I feel that I have become a more experienced programmer and more productive team member because of them. The high degree of trust placed in me gave me full control of completing the goals I set for myself over these terms, and I feel that I have become much more effective at completing tasks independently because of this. Working as part of a small, focused team of individuals was a perfect way to contrast the skills that I have acquired through past academic semesters, and for that I am thankful. Although I wasn\u2019t able to utilize a lot of the programming skills and knowledge I have learned at the University of Guelph, I feel that these work terms were a great way to start my co-operative education.

Other products include Magnet Automate, a tool for automating digital forensics work flows to decrease forensics backlogs, Magnet Atlas, a digital evidence and case management solution, and Magnet Review, a product geared toward reviewing digital evidence from anywhere through an intuitive UI that allows evidence viewing, evidence categorizing, and report generation to present in court cases.",jobDescription:"During my first semester at Magnet Forensics, I worked as a software developer co-op on the Software Tools and Systems (STS) team. This team primarily dealt with tooling and infrastructure that empowered developers on other teams and powered the products that the company developed, and so there was no strict release schedule that work that the team completed had to adhere to. The majority of my efforts over the course of this semester contributed to an internal testing framework built in React. This aspect of my job on STS was by-far my favorite, as it exposed me to web development in React- a Javascript framework that I was not familiar with. Iwas also tasked with working on tickets involving Jenkins, a project automation tool, which was completely unfamiliar to me. This aspect of my job opened my eyes to the complexity of project automation and deployment systems, which has made me more comfortable as a developer, as I was completely unfamiliar with this territory. The third and final aspect of my duties as a software developer on STS was maintaining the API that supported the React testing framework and Jenkins tool previously mentioned. I found that knowledge I learned during my post-secondary studies was most applicable in this area, specifically in object-oriented programming, resource-allocation, and algorithm efficiency in order to ensure that the code I wrote was efficient, understandable, and testable. For my second term at Magnet Forensics, I transitioned to the team working on Magnet Review, but continued to work as a software developer co-op. My experience on this team was much different than on STS, as this team has a semi-rigid release schedule, customer-requested features and bug fixes, and a time-zone difference to deal with, as part of the team is based in The Hague, Netherlands. This team also differed in that testing was a team-based effort, as opposed to the mostly individual effort which was exercised on STS. This was a new experience for me, as neither my previous academic nor co-op experiences had involved this style of testing. Over the course of the semester, I had the opportunity to work on all aspects of the product - frontend, backend, and APIs - allowing for me to gain a deep understanding of some specific parts of the product, while becoming comfortable working on all aspects of the product as a whole. This is commonly-referred to as being \u201cT-shaped\u201d, and is a value that the Review team focuses on significantly. I feel that I could have done more \u201cdeep-diving\u201d into the product in order to become specialized in a higher-level aspect of the product, but this posed a challenge with only four months to spend on the team. I also had the opportunity to work with a small team of developers on performance testing during my time on Review. This endeavor exposed me to working with Amazon Web Services, automated user-interface testing, and understanding how different hardware configurations can affect performance as a whole. This work was especially interesting in that it allowed me to investigate how different aspects of the product performed, and allowed me to discover methods of increasing performance that I didn\u2019t know were possible with the product. Overall, the variety of work that was available on this team resulted in constant excitement towards the work I was doing, as each task differed from the last. Working with the Review team had me excited to come into work everyday to tackle the problems that we faced together.",goals:w,conclusion:"To put it simply, my semesters at Magnet Forensics were amazing. Magnet provided exactly what I was looking for in my final co-op terms - experience working with knowledgeable, passionate individuals towards a common goal of making a real difference in the world. This made each day an experience to look forward to, and made me love my work. Through completing goals that were set for each semester, I was able to expand my technical knowledge to a point where I am much more confident in my skills as a developer, while honing my soft skills pertaining to both written and verbal communication. I feel that Magnet has provided me with a sense of confidence that will help me catch my stride when I enter the workforce post-graduation, and for that I am extremely grateful. My time at Magnet allowed me to gain experience working on entire web-based products, internal tooling infrastructure, and development tools and platforms such as Gitlab, Jenkins,and Gerrit, that made me a more efficient developer. I was able to apply much of the knowledge that I learned in my academic studies in many aspects of my day-to-day tasks, and was provided with an opportunity to expand my soft-skills through pairing with other developers on tickets, reviewing and testing other developers\u2019 code, and coordinating meetings pertaining to tickets I was working on.
