export const introduction = "My name is Christian Cornelis and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph. I recently completed an 8-month co-op work term as an Agricultural Research Development Assistant at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, also known as AAFC. This blog will explore the tasks I completed, the goals I set for myself, the skills I gained, and the challenges I faced during this work term."

export const employerInformation = "     AAFC is a department of the federal government that is tasked with governing agricultural production, inspection, development, and research. I worked as a part of the Science and Technology Branch as a member of the Sustainability Metrics project on the Indicator of the Risk of Water Contamination by Phosphorus (IROWC-P)."

export const jobDescription = "     During my time as an Agricultural Research Development Assistant at AAFC, I collaborated with a small, hard-working team to develop a program to calculate the risk of water contamination by Phosphorus in Python. \
My knowledge of computing and agriculture proved to be extremely beneficial over the course of these work terms, as I could understand much of the content and data that I was required to work with due to my extensive background in both areas. \
My time at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has made me extremely comfortable working with large datasets, as I worked with datasets of Crop Yields, Geographic break-downs, and Census data as part of my day-to-day programming. I worked hard to create scripts to ingest large datasets efficiently and effectively to maintain fast processing time and ease the process of running these scripts. \
     My second work term at AAFC helped me to become a much more independent worker. During my first work term, I had the pleasure of programming alongside another computing co-op student, but during my second term, I programmed completely on my own. This change in my work habits helped me to focus a lot on sharpening my abilities to learn and solve problems independently, and I feel that \
this experience of independence was just as important as working alongside another programmer."

export const goals = [
    "     In my first term, I decided to focus on honing my communication and interpersonal skills, since I was working along with five other co-op students for most of the semester on various tasks. My first goal was to gain more knowledge and understanding of the causes and effects of nutrient loss from agricultural lands, and the ways it can occur. I felt that by focusing on this goal, \
    it would help me with my day-to-day tasks at AAFC by giving me a strong background to assist with the data analysis and modification that I was doing. By the end of my first work term, I feel that I have gained a strong background of what causes nutrient loss from agricultural lands: poor fertilizer application timing, over-application of fertilizers, and poor manure application timing were a few of the causes that I learned about.",
    "     My second goal was to work on my public speaking skills and become more comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas. I chose to develop this area of my communication skillset because I felt that I had not really had a chance to develop it during my previous academic semesters since most of my work was independently-done.  I worked to contribute my thoughts in staff meetings and other group settings and contribute to work-based \
    discussions more often. By the end of my first work term, I felt that I was much more confident sharing my ideas in group settings and speaking my mind.",
    "     My third goal was to work on gaining some experience collaborating on programming projects with others and ensuring that my programs were properly-documented to be understandable to people with little-to-no programming experience. I formed this goal due to how some of my co-workers had to go through my code and document how the IROWC-P algorithm was being implemented. I worked to ensure that my programs had acceptable readability \
    and clarity through use of Pythonic principles and proper commenting practices. My first work term gave me the opportunity to work on the IROWC-P algorithm alongside another computing co-op student, which gave me a lot of experience with programming collaboration for the first time. By the end of my first work term with AAFC, I felt that my programs worked will with those of my computing co-worker, and that my programs were very readable and well-documented for use by my non-computing co-workers.",
    "     In my second term, I decided to focus more on my programming skills, specifically on sharpening my skills working in the Python programming language and adhering to the paradigms and principles that it encapsulates. My first goal was to hone my knowledge and skills of programming in Python by continuing to learn the proper techniques and methodologies of this language. I felt that by doing this, the quality of my code would be vastly \
    improved, and it would aid in furthering my comfortability using Python. By the end of the second term, I found that I was more skilled and knowledgeable in programming in Python and felt substantially more comfortable using the language.",
    "     My second goal for my second work term was to work to become more effective and creative at solving complex problems that occurred when developing the IROWC-P program. I felt that this goal was necessary because brainstorming creative solutions to implementing complex algorithms in Python became a large part of my daily routine in the second work term, as I no longer had another programmer working alongside me. I felt that by completing \
    this goal, it would speed up debugging sessions and further my productivity while programming. I was successful in completing this goal by the end of the semester as I was much more efficient at implementing algorithms that were incorporated into the IROWC-P algorithm and debugging at the end of the semester then I was at the beginning of my work term. Solving complex problems that occurred when developing the IROWC-P program became less problematic due to my efficiency in their implementation.",
    "     My final goal for my second work term was to continue to sharpen my skills and efficiency when debugging. Over the course of my first work term, I felt that my debugging skills could use improvement when working on an algorithm to allocate fertilizer sales data for use by the IROWC-P program. This algorithm proved to be a particularly challenging aspect of my co-op position, as it required extensive critical thinking and planning to implement, \
    as constant manipulation of data to and from multiple geographic scales was vital to the algorithm. In the end, I felt that I was successful in completing this goal, as I could debug this algorithm extensively and more efficiently. I continued to methodically debug by stepping through the program bits at a time and focus on where bugs originated from, rather than trying to look at the entire program at once and solve the issue."

export const conclusion = "     In conclusion, my work terms at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada have been remarkable and I feel that I have become a more experienced programmer and more productive team member because of them. The high degree of trust placed in me gave me full control of completing the goals I set for myself over these terms, and I feel that I have become much more effective at completing tasks independently because of this. \
Working as part of a small, focused team of individuals was a perfect way to contrast the skills that I have acquired through past academic semesters, and for that I am thankful. Although I wasnâ€™t able to utilize a lot of the programming skills and knowledge I have learned at the University of Guelph, I feel that these work terms were a great way to start my co-operative education. I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to have worked at AAFC. \
     In the future, I hope to find a co-op placement with more of a development role where I can apply my knowledge of data structures and algorithms more often."

export const acknowledgements = "     I would like to thank Keith Reid, Patrick Handyside, and Sonja Fransen for providing me with an enjoyable and interesting work environment over the span of my eight months with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Their accommodation and high degree of trust in my work and skills made my work terms incredibly rewarding. I would specifically like to thank Keith Reid for his flexibility in my working hours, and for allowing \
me to have flexible hours to allow me to attend class during normal work hours, which has helped to get prerequisites for changing my minor from Geographic Information Systems and Environmental Analysis to Agriculture. \
     I would also like to thank Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts for their dedication to the co-op program and their constant support with any questions and concerns I have had, and continued to have, with matters related to co-op. Their support is extremely appreciated. \
     Lastly, I would like to thank Greg Klotz for his continued assistance throughout the years in course selection and program advisory. A special thank you goes to Doctor Klotz for reviewing this report as well."
