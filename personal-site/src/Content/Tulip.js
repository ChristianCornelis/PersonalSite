export const introduction = "My name is Christian Cornelis and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph. \
I recently completed a 4-month co-op work term as a Software Developer at Tulip Retail. This blog will explore the tasks I completed, the \
goals I set for myself, the skills I gained, and the challenges I faced during my third work term.";

export const employerInformation = "Tulip is a retail technology company with offices in Kitchener and Toronto. Their key focus is on empowering \
store associates to create unique experiences for customers. I worked as a part of the Innovation team where I created useful demos of the Tulip platform \
for the Sales team and worked on new projects to enhance the Tulip Platform.";

export const jobDescription = "During my time at Tulip Retail as a Software Developer, I was given the opportunity to work on the Innovation team. This small, \
but extremely capable, team is tasked with implementing new ideas into the Tulip Platform. During my time at Tulip, this team was also tasked with managing and \
developing demo environments for the sales team to use in pitches.\nThe first half of my term was spent working on the Demo Team (a subteam of the Innovation team), \
where I quickly became knowledgeable in setting up a instances of the Tulip Platform, configuring specific details for sales pitch stores, and creating efficient ways \
for sales engineers to become autonomous. This was a very interesting experience, as it gave me a very detailed look into Tulip’s entire stack, seeing as I had to configure \
instances of the platform from scratch multiple times. Developing ways for sales engineers to become more independent was also rewarding, as it was a great opportunity to learn new technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery. \n\
The second half of my term was spent working as a full-fledged member of the innovation team. I was given the chance to learn a lot about the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), \
and was able to work on the development of a PHP library to handle creating and maintaining instances of Google Pub Sub message queues. Other notable projects included using \
a machine learning GCP function to parse incoming texts and determine the emotion portrayed in them and working on a new, efficient way for customers to input their contact info \
and marketing preferences.\nThis term allowed me to work both independently, and in a team-based setting, which allowed me to become more comfortable and efficient in both settings. \
This was very helpful in both reaching my work term goals and my professional development as a whole."

export const goals = [
    "This work term, I focused on developing my technical skills, as I felt that my previous two work terms developed my soft skills quite well. My first goal was to improve my debugging \
    skills in order to be more efficient when dealing with bugs in demo builds. I felt that by improving my debugging skills I could be more efficient when creating demo environments for \
    the sales team. By the end of the term, I felt that I was successful in completing this goal. I utilized PHPStorm’s Debugger service to diagnose and fix bugs that I experienced throughout \
    my work, and became much more efficient and finding and fixing bugs once I was familiar with Tulip’s stack.",
    
    "My second goal was to work to become more experienced modifying and creating PHP scripts. I felt that by focusing on becoming a more experienced PHP developer it would lead to me creating \
    more intricate web applications and assist me in creating interesting side projects. At the end of the term, I felt that I was very successful in achieving this goal. I was able to write \
    multiple web app back-ends in PHP, as well as modify other developer’s scripts to be more efficient. I am now much more proficient at writing and modifying PHP scripts, and am quite familiar \
    with the language’s built-in functions and tools. I hope to continue to work with PHP as my work with it this work term has made me very fond of it.",
    
    "The third goal that I set for this work term was to gain more experience working on complex iOS apps in Swift. After completing CIS 4500, which focused on iOS application development using Swift, \
    I felt that this completing this goal would be quite rewarding, as it was an excellent opportunity to expand on what I learned in my academics; however, I was not able to complete it due to my team’s \
    priorities changing.  I will point out that I was given the opportunity to do some light iOS work by modifying some apps to adhere to the needs of the sales team, which was very challenging and informative. \
    Instead of working on an iOS app integration, as was planned, I was able to work on a Google Pub Sub library in PHP, which was extremely interesting.",

    "The fourth goal I set for myself was to improve my documenting skills in order to convey my work and bug fixes more effectively to my team members. Upon completing my onboarding at Tulip, I found that I was \
    very prepared to fulfill most of the duties expected of me as part of my job, but felt that there was a lack of documentation to complete smaller, more intricate tasks that were required to upkeep demos for the \
    sales team. By completing this goal, I was creating useful documentation for future co-op students as well, which I thought would be very beneficial. I feel that I was very successful in completing this goal as my \
    documenting skills have sharpened immensely through my own hard work and very helpful feedback on my documentation from co-workers.",

    "The fifth, and final, goal that I set for this work term was to become more experienced in developing web applications. Although this is quite a broadly-defined goal, I felt that it was very beneficial for me to \
    focus on, as the only web development experience I had previous to this work term was from assignments completed in CIS 2750. After this work term, I feel that I was very successful in completing this goal, as I \
    gained a vast amount of experience in developing web applications. I was able to work with another co-op student to create a web application (as well as other web apps) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, \
    and PHP for the backend, which was very informative, challenging, and fun. Through working towards this goal, I have discovered that I really enjoy building and developing web applications, and am eager to learn more!"

export const conclusion = "To conclude, I feel that my work term at Tulip Retail was extremely successful. I gained a lot of development experience, which I was really hoping to achieve at the end of my previous two work terms, \
and got to work as part of the amazing Innovation Team. My co-workers were all wonderful people to work with, and never hesitated to lend a helping hand whenever I was stuck with a problem or having issues. \n\
After this work term, I feel that I am much more confident in my skills as a developer, and can approach difficult programming tasks with more knowledge and less hesitation. Both my technical and communication skills were heightened \
dramatically during my time at Tulip Retail, and for that I am thankful.";

export const acknowledgements = "I would like to thank Drew Matheson for all of his work as my designated buddy for the semester. His in-depth knowledge of much of the technology that I worked with over this work term was extremely \
helpful whenever I turned to him with questions related to my work. I would also like to thank Amir Habibi for his constant feedback and accommodation as my manager over this work term. He’s an amazing leader and his guidance over the \
semester was extremely helpful in advancing development skills and achieving my work term goals. Finally, I would like to the rest of my coworkers at Tulip Retail for providing an incredible work environment for this work term. Everyone’s \
kindness and willingness to help whenever necessary is unprecedented in my experience. \n\
I would also like to thank Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts for their dedication to the co-op program and their constant support with any questions and concerns I have had, and continued to have, with matters related to co-op. Their support is extremely appreciated. \n\
